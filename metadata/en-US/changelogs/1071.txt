Ampersand Alpha 0.1.11

Hotfix: Some SVG icons weren't being rendered properly. This has been fixed now.

Since it's an almost immediate hotfix, please refer to the old 0.1.10 changelog:

New:
- New Markdown syntax: Callouts, border around the text, text shadow, centered text, blurred text, marquee, SVG icons.

Fixes and changes:
- Fixed post preview with covers showing up at the center of the element and breaking up the title, author and timestamp in some cases; now they show up on the right.
- Refreshed the Journal Edit user interface, moved some elements away from the input area so there's less distraction when writing a post.
- Upgraded dependencies to their latest versions.
- Improve build tooling.
