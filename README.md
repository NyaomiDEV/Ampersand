## What is Ampersand?

Ampersand is a research project, and also an app. It wants to do one thing and do it reasonably well: tracking and journaling for plural systems.

## Wait, why would anyone reinvent the wheel?

Because all other approaches up until now are cloud based. We need at least one app that can be used fully offline, and that is developed with an offline-first mindset.

## So, is this for privacy reasons?

It is not. It's just because it's unreasonable that other apps and services out here do require an account somewhere to work, and while some do offer an "offline mode", they still require online signup. What if one wants their data to live and die on their phone/tablet/desktop/laptop?

But if you want to think of it on those terms, sure, having an offline app could also mean privacy.

## Is Ampersand something I can use on a day-to-day basis?

Ampersand is NOT something you can use on a day-to-day basis. Or at least, not yet.

Do not expect stability from an application still in its infancy.

Currently Ampersand performs poorly for systems with a large number of members, tags or custom fields; therefore, if you're a polyfragmented system, please stick with more stable alternatives until we solve all the issues contributing to this instability.

Other than this, Ampersand is still to be considered alpha software, meaning it still has a long ways to go.

## What is Ampersand compatible with?

The Android app is compatible with:
Android >= 8, provided Android System WebView is installed and used (check developer settings if unsure) and at least version >= 131

The PC version is compatible with:
- Linux computers (the majority of them, provided they're updated + you could compile Ampersand on one, it's easy!)
- Windows computers:
  - Running Windows 11
  - Snapdragon X laptops are not supported (check if yours is one [here](https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/laptops-and-tablets/laptop-device-finder))
- Macs:
  - All Mac Studios
  - Mac Mini 2020 or later
  - Mac Pro 2023 or later
  - iMac 24" 2021 or later
  - MacBook Pro 14 inches, 2021 or later
  - MacBook Pro 16 inches, 2021 or later
  - MacBook Pro 13 inches, (M1) late 2020 or later
  - MacBook Air, (M1) late 2020 or later

## Where can I get Ampersand?

We'd kindly advise you to install Ampersand outside of Google Play, given the nature of some legislations across the world that could take us the right to publishing there away.


Ampersand is available through Obtainium: https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/

Also you can download it through our GitHub mirror: https://github.com/NyaomiDEV/Ampersand/releases

Finally, and again please try to not be lazy about this, you can download it through Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.ampersand.app

## Can I contribute code?

Of course you can! And if you're not able to contribute code, you can still hang around, translate the app and brainstorm ideas!

## Can I fund you?

We'd be very glad to receive funds, and we've set [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Ampersand/) to collect them. Please donate!
